        <h2>Principal's Message</h2>
    <div class="aboutusText">
        <p>The golden Words "Empowering minds shaping future" under the logo of R.S.S.S. reflect the philosophy and ideology of the school. Education not only pertains to the acquisition of Knowledge, skills, beliefs, habits and morals but it shapes human beings into personalities, which is an important aspect in life. With this intention, we are devoted to set benchmark in nurturing our students to grow into strong, kind, matured and intelligent. They must be well equipped to face the new challenges of the competitive society and we are moving on the right track.
R.S.S.S. takes its birth an January 2024 with class IX, X, XI and XII having Arts, Science and Commerce stream in both Assamese and English medium. A number of initiatives have been taken to further enhance quality to ensure well rounded personality development of our students. Seminars, workshop, webiners, are a few of such initiative to ascertain benefits  for each stakeholder. With a dedicated   set of faculty and an excellent infrastructure, the college ensures that students are provided the best environment to learn and grow. R.S.S.S. will have been working to make it’s children cultured and wise. Life itself is an art and so we always try to transform our children into an artist. As. A. P.J. Abdul Kalam said "Every youth is unique",  we at R.S.S.S. aim to achieve holistic development of each and every student so that tomorrow they can stand on their own feet and explore new ventures that await for them at every juncture of their lives. The school shall forever look to address any grievances that students might face in their journeys of education and hence-forth would try to implement as many apt and necessary steps as required, so shat when they leave the institution they carry forth an individual identity their own.
At this moment, I express  my gratitude to all whose contribution have brought the institution to this point and hope to build upon it with the contribution and co-operation as all the stakeholders. With these words, I extend my hearty welcome to the students from all corners of the state to these premier  institution to build their bright future career under the guidance  and teaching of a competent and experienced teaching staff. I also heartily anticipate all creative suggestion from the learned guardians always to translate the cherished plan of this Institution into expected reality . Thus, in fine I would like to quote the lines of Robert Frost “And miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before I sleep.”
